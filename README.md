## Use cases

AI and generative code has become a bigger thing and if you often use AI to generate the code for you like I do, this simple extension might be for you. 

Sometimes it might be useful to input the file structure of your workspace into the chat interface of your preferred AI to get higher quality code. But having to manuly type it in can be frustrating and time consuming, especially with large workspaces.

The goal of this extension is to save you time and simply paste the contents of your generated Markdown file into the Chatbot text field. Some AI's that you use might be already as a downloadable extension in your IDE, but not all have context awareness across your project.

I hope you like this extension and find it useful for your usecases!
